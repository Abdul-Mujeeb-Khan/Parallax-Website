      <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
      <p>
        Parallax scrolling is used to add visual interest to a website and
        engage users as they scroll through a web page. In a parallax scrolling
        effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the
        background typically moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of
        depth.By using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) — the coding language used
        to enhance the appearance of your website — you can create engaging,
        scrolling features that can help to tell the story of your
        brand.Parallax scrolling is a visual effect where the background of a
        web page appears to stay still while the foreground shifts vertically or
        horizontally. Parallax scrolling is used to add visual interest to a
        website and engage users as they scroll through a web page.In a parallax
        scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the
        background typically moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of
        depth. Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a fascinating and
        seamless virtual experience.A slower moving background embodies the same
        type of feeling as when you are inside a moving vehicle looking out: the
        sky and clouds in the background appear to move at a slower pace than
        the trees and houses in the foreground. Let’s take a look at this effect
        in play.
